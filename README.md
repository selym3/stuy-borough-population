## Homework

Here are the [population statistics](/resources/nyc-population.csv) for the NYC Boroughs from 1790 until 2010.

Q1. Choose a borough, and create a normal line plot of its population from 1790 to 2010.  Label axes, title, etc.  Save the graph as a .GIF file.

Q2. Now try this with all 5 boroughs on the same graph.  Make sure you've got the lines labeled by color, so we can tell which line belongs to which borough.  Save the graph as another .GIF file.

Now create a web page showing off those graphs, with some explanation.  Check the webpage on your computer.  Then upload the webpage and the supporting GIF images to moe into your public_html file, and **check** to see if you can display it from moe in your browser.  Put that URL into the Comments-to-teacher (of tale of woe if you can't).
